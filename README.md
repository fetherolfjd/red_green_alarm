# red_green_alarm

My kids each have a stoplight alarm clock in their rooms, that have the red light illuminated until the set alarm time, at which point the green light turns on for a period of time; half hour maybe?

These clocks are not very small and thus not practical to travel with, so this
is an app created in Flutter to replicate that functionality.
